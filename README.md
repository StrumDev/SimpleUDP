SimpleUDP - This is a simple implementation of reliable delivery of packages by the UDP. This project was developed by me and why not, maybe someone is interested in how simple delivery of packets via UDP works. This project is not an example of the most productive of reliable UDP. I wanted to make a very simple example of reliable packet delivery over UDP.

# Technical details

* 2 channel and small packet size: Unreliable: 1 byte / Reliable: 3 byte.
* Simple implementation
* CCU: No limit
* Easy to use
* Free license ( MIT License  )
* Only UDP

I will update some elements in the future to make it easier and more productive.
