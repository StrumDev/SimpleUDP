# SimpleUDP v0.4.0

SimpleUDP is a simple network library that provides reliable and unreliable messages.

This is my first project that I spent a lot of time on.
I developed this project myself, starting without knowledge of C# and how the network works, so please be understanding.

The project is still raw, and there may be radical changes in functionality and variable names from version to version, as I am still learning on my own, which is very difficult for me, so please understand.
