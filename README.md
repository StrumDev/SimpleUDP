# SimpleUDP v0.3.0

SimpleUDP is a simple network library that provides reliable and unreliable messages.

This is my first project on which I spent a considerable amount of time  to understand how the network works. This network library is primarily designed to create virtual connections  and transmit reliable data over the UDP protocol. The project is not yet fully completed, so I do not know how frequently  updates will be released. This project is not something powerful or efficient; I made it to learn  how to finish projects rather than start and not complete them.

The project is still raw, I am still learning, so I ask for your understanding.
