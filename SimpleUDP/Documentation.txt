Client 
    Menhods:
        Tick(); // Call this method when you want to process the data
        Connect(IpAddres, Port); // Creates a connection between the server and the client
        Disconnect(IsReliable); // Terminates the connection to the server: ( IsReliable = true: The client will wait for a response from the server )
        Send(Channel, Data); // Send a package: true send reliably, false unreliably
        Stop(); // Stop the client quietly
    Callback:
        OnConnected(); // Called when the client has successfully connected
        OnDisconnected(); // Called when the client has disconnected
        OnHandler(Data, Channel); // Receives packets
    Parameters:
        bool IsRunning // If the client expects packets then true
        uint MaxTimeOut = Milliseconds; // The time after which the connection will be terminated
        bool IsConnected, IsConnecting, IsDisconnecting;
Server 
    Menhods:
        Tick(); // Call this method when you want to process the data
        Start(Port); // Starts waiting for packets and connections
        Disconnect(ClientId); // Force disconnect the client
        Send(ClientId, Channel, Data); // Send a package one client: true send reliably, false unreliably
        SendAll(Channel, Data); // Send the package to all but one client: true send reliably, false unreliably
        SendAll(ClientId, Channel, Data); // Send a package all clients: true send reliably, false unreliably
        GetClientEndPoint(ClientId) // Get client EndPoint
        Stop(); // Stop the server quietly
    Callback:
        OnClientConnected(ClientId); // When the client connects
        OnClientDisconnected(ClientId); // When the client disconnects
        OnHandler(ClientId, Data, Channel); // Receives packets
    Parameters:
        bool IsRunning // If the server expects packets then true
        uint MaxTimeOut = Milliseconds; // The time after which the connection will be terminated

From time to time I will correct errors if I find or you.
